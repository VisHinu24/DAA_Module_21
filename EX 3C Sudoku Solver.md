# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE: 29-04-2025
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.


## Algorithm
1. Start with a 9Ã—9 Sudoku board where empty cells are marked with 0.
2. Find the next empty cell (i.e., value 0) on the board.
3. For numbers from 1 to 9:.
4. Check if the number is safe:.
5. Check if placing the number doesn't lead to a solution:.
6. Check if all cells are filled and constraints are satisfied:
7. End the program when all possibilities are exhausted.

## Program:
